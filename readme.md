## Directions 
### Step #1 - Title your poem <br>
To practice the basics of HTML, let's have you write and markup a poem. To start off with, what will the title of your poem* be?
<br><br>
Using the `<h1>` tag we learned about, add a heading for your poem. This will be your title.

<i>*If you do not want to write a poem, feel free to use music lyrics to a song instead</i>
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Write your poem <br>
Now, below your heading, write the poem inside a paragraph tag. Your amazing poem should be multiple lines long, so you'll need to use a tag to make line breaks, too.
<br><br>
Remember that your `<p>` and `<br>` tags should be between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags.

  <h1> for island fires and family</h1>

    <h6>Wasn't it love as soon as we knew each other properly?
<br>Livin' 'bout half right 'til a certain person got to me
<br>Nothin' is secret, everythin's sacred, how it ought to be
<br>Under the moonlight on a clear night
<br>On rooftops is where I want to be
<br>Sometimes I'm like a child, that's somethin' I can't release
<br>Dreams of her comin' home, sweet home
<br>And I'm tellin' you home is so sweet
<br>Said you reminded me of the summertime, and I still mean that
<br>In a full room, I'm the only one she's smilin' at
<br>So wouldn't you let me know if you were thinkin' less of me?
<br>That's what she asked me
What was promised, what we both agreed
<br>But truthfully, if you ever go
You'll drop me straight to Hell, the 7th circle
And I was talkin' with you earlier
<br>We were open and vulnerable, it was wonderful
<br>I, I used to dream that you would talk to me
